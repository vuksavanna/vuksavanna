                    <p>I created the San José rebranding project for my midterm project in UC Berkekeley's
                        Graphic Design Principles course. My hometown of San José, California has a rich
                        history and diverse groups of communities living eithin our city.

                    <p>Created a fresh & simple look for LunarPeach's branding and created graphics
                        for their Instagram business launch.

                <p>
                                    Like many of the cities located within the Bay Area, San José was originally
                    Ohlone land. The Muwekma Ohlone tribe inhabited the area up until the 1800s
                    when Spaniards arrived and built missionaries. During the period of the goldrush, it
                    became established as a place rich in mercury or ‘quicksilver,’ and would go on to
                    become the first capital of California a few years later in 1848. And before it
                    became the tech hub that it is today, San José’s Silicon Valley was ‘Valley of Heart’s
                    Delight’. It was known for the acres of orchards that formed rows into the soil in
                    every direction. At one point it held 7,829,677 fruit trees, over seven times the
                    current population. During this time, Cesar Chaves would champion the
                    farmworkers movement with the United Farm Workers labor union. It wasn’t until
                    very recently in the 1970s that San José became the center of the technology scene.
