                    <h3>overview</h3>
                    <p>IN SEASON is an idea born from a personal struggle.
                    </p>
                    <p>IN SEASON is a website to help people identify fresh produce at local markets. 
                        It lists characteristics of different seasonal fruits and vegetables, and 
                        provides tips on how to prepare certain produce!
                    </p>

                <h3>why in season?</h3>
                <p>Growing up as an Asian American, a lot of acts of affection are conveyed with food. 
                    Fruit in particular hold a special place in my heart—from the way my bà ngoại (maternal 
                    grandmother) makes me dried persimmons from her trees, or the way my dad buys yellow 
                    dragon fruit even though they're expensive because he knows I like them
                    
                    Coming to college I realized I had taken the fresh fruit & vegetables at home for 
                    granted. I never knew the ‘right time’ to buy certain produce and picking good produce 
                    was not a skill that I had
                    
                    After moving into an apartment with my friends, I realized they were just as bad as 
                    me if not worse (one time I let my friend go grocery shopping by himself and he bought 
                    wilted green onions...)
                
                    Hopefully this site can help others in similar situations enjoy the taste of fresh 
                    produce :)
                </p>

                <p>The landing page features options to sort through produce by the seasons they are available 
                    in. The window blind animation and scenery change serves as an added touch to provide 
                    feedback to user input, and to enhance the overall experience of site navigation.

                <p>Under the How to Prepare tab, steps, tips, and visuals for various basic preparation techniques are listed.
                </p>
                <p>Fun fact: A total of 21 unique assets were created for the fruit and vegetable icons used throughout the site! </p>
